-- When you put this CD into your drive, an installation menu will open
automatically. If it does not, run "rehab_autorun.exe" from the root level of the CD-ROM. From this menu, go down the list to run each required installer. Of
these installers, QuickTime is required for the courseware program to run.

-- If you are running this program on a Windows NT, ME, 2000 or XP Pro system, 
and you are not logged in with administrator privileges, you may experience 
problems with the display of certain fonts. It is recommended that you run 
this program on a machine in which you do have administrator privileges.

-- Your monitor must be set to display "High Color(16 bit)" at 800 x 600
resolution or higher. Fortunately, most computers for the last few years have
already been set to this resolution or higher, by default. If you do need to
change your monitor settings, please consult your Windows documentation or
Windows Help to do so.

-- The recommended system for smooth playback of this courseware is a Pentium
II 300Mhz with 96 MB RAM or more and a 12x CD-ROM or faster. A
Soundblaster-compatible sound card and speakers are required.

-- It's important to minimize the number of other programs running while you're
running this CD. This can slow it down or even cause a crash. During the
software instruction and exercise sections, you are encouraged to have the
software being taught open and to ALT-TAB back and forth between it and this
courseware. However, it is recommended that you close all non-essential
programs such as e-mail clients, web browsers, etc.

-- If adequate space is available, you may be able to improve performance by
running this program from your hard drive. To do so, copy the entire contents
of the CD (minus the "QuickTimeInstaller" folder if you've already installed
QuickTime) to a folder of your choosing on your hard drive. Note: the program
content of this disc is almost 600 MB.

-- If performance problems persist, try restarting your computer. This may
improve playback performance of this courseware.

-- If you experience techical problems that don't improve with the above
suggestions, please make a note of exactly where in the program you were when
the problem(s) ocurred and contact the developers at either of the e-mail
addresses below. Please include as much detail as you can about the problem(s)
and about your computer (processor speed, amount of ram, type of video card and
sound card, etc.).
